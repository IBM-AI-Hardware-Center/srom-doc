*IBM SROM (Smarter Resource Operation Management) ToolKit* is an Python toolkit for
exploring and using the capabilities of novel machine learning algorithms and pipelines. SROM provide a collection of solutions for intelligent machine learning for different use cases.

Components
----------

SROM is a toolkit that:

* Provides a consistent programming model for building AI/ML solutions.
* Provides a scalable execution approach to:
   * model training
   * hyperparameter tuning (HPT)
   * deployment of on and off-premises solutions.
* Extends open source platforms and algorithms to provide industry-specific templates and tooling for frequently occurring use cases
   * Anomaly Detection
   * Cognitive Plant Advisor
   * Failure Prediction
   * Root Cause Analysis
   * Survival Analysis
   * Time Series Prediction


How to cite
